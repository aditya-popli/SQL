## ðŸ§¾ Problem Description

You are given a table named `Products` with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type         |
|-------------|--------------|
| product_id  | int          |
| low_fats    | enum('Y','N') |
| recyclable  | enum('Y','N') |

- `product_id` is the **primary key** for this table.
- `low_fats` is an ENUM where `'Y'` means the product is low fat, and `'N'` means it is not.
- `recyclable` is an ENUM where `'Y'` means the product is recyclable, and `'N'` means it is not.
